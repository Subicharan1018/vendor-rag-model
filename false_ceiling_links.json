        "description": "INTRODUCTION :\nPERLITE is not a trade name but a generic term for naturally occurring siliceous volcanic rock, which when heated in excess of 870 0C, expands four to twenty times its original volume and is transformed into lightweight glass-like particles containing countless sealed cells. This unique structure accounts for its superior insulating characteristics.\n  PERLIMIX is a light weight Perlite based aggregate which when combined with portland cement and water produces an ultra light weight concrete that is used for insulating roof decks and lightweight floor fills, insulating structural rock decks, curtain wall systems and for a variety of permanent insulating applications.\n  PERLITE-MIX is a very unique insulating material especially when studied in comparison with other conventional insulating materials e.g. Vermiculite, EPS, PUF etc. All the insulating materials are either used for cold (cryogenic) or hot (thermal), whereas Perlite is the only insulating material which is used for both cold as well as hot insulation.\n Note :\nWater should be clean and free of deleterious substances. AEA is used in Perlimix to reduce segregation and entrain air out. The use of AEA must be carefully controlled to accomplish the desired results without reducing the strength of the concrete. We recommend water proofing over the light weight Perliteimix cement concrete. One can apply normal roofing materials like Mosaic Tiles, PCC, Tiles etc. over the Perlite-mix insulation layer.\nØ PRODUCT / APPLICATION FEATURES.\n  v Light weight.\nv Energy saving.\nv Chemically Inert.\nv Adaptable on curved surfaces.\nv Excellent workability,\nMonolithic surface.\nv Excellent roofing substrate.\nv Fire retardant & non-combustible.\nv Slope to drain.\nv Durable and permanent.\n  v No asbestos.",
